        <p>Project documentation is a vital part of project management. It's also every project manager's least favorite
            task.</p>

        <p>It may seem tedious, but comprehensive documentation is what can make the difference between the success and
            failure of your project. Let's dive deeper into what project documentation actually is and why it's worth
            your time.</p>

            <header>What is project documentation?</header>
            <p>
                <code>Project documentation</code> is the process of recording the key project details and producing the
                documents that
                are
                required to implement it successfully. Simply put, it's an umbrella term which includes all the
                documents
                created over the course of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Project documents come in many forms – from project proposals and business cases, to project plans and
                project
                status reports.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Examples_of_project_documents">

            <header>Examples of project documents</header>
            <p>
                It's difficult to strictly define what should be documented over the course of a project, as it's
                strongly
                dependent on the kind of project you are managing. A major project at a big enterprise usually requires
                a
                lot
                more paperwork than a small-scale initiative at an early-stage startup.
            </p>

            <p>
                But some basic documents are needed in most cases. Here are five project document examples that your
                project
                will likely require.
            </p>

            <h4>Project proposal</h4>
            <p>
                A project proposal is written to initiate a project – it's the first step in the project management
                process.
                The
                goal of this document is to convince the decision-makers and stakeholders that the idea behind the
                project
                is
                worth pursuing. A project proposal needs to outline the project's core value proposition, which is often
                done in
                the form of a business case.
            </p>
            <div class="img-bg">
                <img src="https://www.nuclino.com/img/articles/project-documentation-software-nuclino.png" />
            </div>

            <h4>Project charter</h4>
            <p>
                A project charter is another key project documentation example. This document lays the foundation for
                the
                project by covering the high-level project planning. It needs to outline how the business goals of the
                project
                will be achieved by explaining the key requirements, budget, tasks, roles, and responsiblities of the
                project.
                It’s the first document you write after your project proposal is formally approved.
            </p>

            <h4>Project plan</h4>
            <p>
                After the high-level planning is complete, the project manager creates a more detailed project plan. It
                serves
                as a roadmap for the project, defining the key project milestones and placing them on a timeline. This
                document
                evolves together with the project, capturing all changes and decisions and facilitating communication
                among
                project stakeholders.
            </p>

            <h4>Project status report</h4>
            <p>
                Depending on the scope of your project and the size of our team, keeping everyone up-to-date may become
                difficult. Project status reports are written to keep all project stakeholders – both internal and
                external
                – on
                the same page. These documents usually contain an overview of the progress you've made so far and the
                next
                steps
                you are planning to take.
            </p>

            <h4>Project retrospective</h4>
            <p>
                Every project is a learning opportunity. What went well? What could be improved next time? After you
                conclude
                the project, sit together with your team and do a project retrospective. Document your lessons learned
                in a
                separate document and use it as a reference for your next project.
            </p>

            <h4>Other project document examples</h4>
            <p>
                This was by no means an exhaustive list. Some large-scale projects require hundreds of separate
                documents
                and
                forms, while smaller projects tend to simplify and combine them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Depending on the type of project you are planning to undertake, you may want to additionally create some
                of
                the
                following project documents:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Project scope statement</li>
                <li>Business requirements document</li>
                <li>Risk management plan</li>
                <li>Cost management plan</li>
                <li>Communication plan</li>
                <li>Financial plan</li>
                <li>QA plan</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="The_value_of_project_documentation">

            <header>The value of project documentation</header>
            <p>
                The first and perhaps the most important reason why you should document your project is simple – <code>
                    writing
                    things
                    down forces you to think through your idea
                </code> and to verify if it actually makes sense. It also makes your
                project
                much easier to manage by helping your team to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Clarify the project expectations and objectives</li>
                <li>Break down the work into manageable blocks</li>
                <li>Plan and assign resources</li>
                <li>Ensure that all stakeholders are informed about the progress</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But it can also create long-term benefits for your organization even after the project is concluded:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>Faster new employee onboarding.</code> Good project documentation gives new team members
                    access to all the
                    knowledge
                    that has been collected over the course of your projects, both past and ongoing. New team members
                    are
                    able to
                    immediately understand decisions made in the past and to find relevant information without having to
                    ask
                    others
                    on the team over the course of many weeks.
                </li>
                <li><code>Better cross-team alignment.</code> Thorough documentation brings clarity and transparency to
                    what everyone is
                    working
                    on. As a result, decisions and discussions don't get scattered over chat and email, less time is
                    spent
                    in
                    meetings, and work is less likely to get duplicated.
                </li>
                <li><code>More effective knowledge management. </code> The insights and lessons learned from one project
                    can be
                    transferred to new
                    projects. Capturing and sharing this knowledge can help you develop new best practices, prevent
                    repeated
                    mistakes, and continuously improve your team's overall performance.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But in order to deliver on these goals, your documentation needs to be well-written, accurate, and
                up-to-date.
                In this guide, we will cover the tools and best practices you can use to improve the quality of your
                project
                documentation.

        <section class="main-section" id="Choosing_the_right_documentation_software">

            <header>Choosing the right documentation software</header>
            <p>
                There are many different tools you can use to document a project – Google Docs, Confluence (and a
                variety of
                Confluence alternatives), different types of internal wikis and knowledge bases, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Depending on the size of your team and your approach to project management, your requirements may
                differ.
                Some
                teams need complex solutions with advanced features, such as built-in approval workflows and automated
                tasks,
                while others prefer simpler and easier tools with no learning curve. Whatever tool you choose, make sure
                all
                project stakeholders know how to use it.
            </p>

            <p>In any case, an ideal project documentation tool should:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Be <code>easily editable</code> even by non-technical users, ideally, <code>in real time.</code>
                </li>
                <li>Provide an instant and <code>reliable search</code> function.</li>
                <li>Have <code>intuitive navigation.</code></li>
                <li>Make it easy to <code>organize content.</code></li>
                <li><code>Integrate with other tools</code> to keep all your project assets in sync.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One such documentation tool is Nuclino – create an account and give it a try:</p>
            <div class="img-bg">
                <img src="https://www.nuclino.com/img/articles/project-documentation-software.png" />
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="How_to_document_a_project">

            <header>How to document a project</header>
            <p>
                Part of what makes project documentation seem so frustrating – and even useless – is that the finished
                documents
                are often not read by anyone. Documentation is created only because it's what you're expected to do, and
                then
                immediately forgotten and discarded.
            </p>

            <p>There are a few ways to ensure that the time you invest in documenting your project is not wasted:</p>

            <h4>Organize all project documentation in one place</h4>
            <p>
                Project-related communication tends to scatter across meetings, chat, email, and shared drives, leaving
                your
                team without a single source of truth. Instead, bring all project-related documents together in one
                place
                and
                don't waste time hunting through outdated Confluence pages or stale emails.
            </p>
            <div class="img-bg">
                <img src="https://www.nuclino.com/img/articles/organized-project-documentation.png" />
            </div>

            <h4>Make it easy to access and search</h4>
            <p>
                The easier you make it for people to find the information they need, the more likely they will be to
                read
                the
                documentation. Make sure your documentation tool is equipped with a reliable and fast search feature.
            </p>

            <h4>Keep it lightweight</h4>
            <p>
                While it's important to keep your project documentaion thorough, it also needs to be concise. No one
                will
                bother
                reading pages and pages of text – write down what you need and only what you need, with a clear purpose
                and
                audience in mind. Follow the rules of Agile documentation.
            </p>

            <h4>Collaboratively maintain it</h4>
            <p>
                Don't rush to laminate your project documents. As your project evolves and progresses, many key details
                may
                change, and your documentation needs to keep up. Create living documentation and give stakeholders
                access to
                share feedback, ask questions, and update it as needed.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Project_documentation_template">
            <header>Project documentation template</header>
            <p>
                Every project is different and there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to project documentation. But
                this
                simple one-page project documentation template can be a good starting point.
            </p>
            <p>
                As your project evolves and your documentation becomes more detailed, you may want to split it into
                separate
                documents to keep things more organized.
