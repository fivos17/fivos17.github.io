                Saint Jiub the Eradicator was a Saint of both the Tribunal Temple and the New Temple. He was named a saint after cleansing Vvardenfell of the Cliff Racer menace. He was later killed in the city of Kvatch by a Dremora during the Oblivion Crisis, and his soul was sent to the Soul Cairn.

            <h3 id="headline">History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Early life</strong> - Jiub's early life was a dark experience, and a time that he himself deeply regrets. Killing was always high in demand in his homeland of Morrowind, and so he worked as a low-grade killer for hire to support his Skooma addiction. It was a decision that led to his eventual capture and imprisonment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Imprisonment</strong> - Jiub was sent to prison after a failed assassination on a high-ranking official of House Redoran. A rival assassin from the legally sanctioned assassin guild known as the Morag Tong reached Jiub's target first and alerted the local guards to cover his tracks. Jiub was later sent to jail in the city of Vivec after being found guilty in his trial.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>New purpose</strong> - After his release in 3E 427, he was transported by ship alongside the Nerevarine from the Imperial City to Vvardenfell, Morrowind. It was during this time that he decided to turn his life around to seek redemption for his crimes. He felt obligated to give something back to the people of Morrowind, so he decided to undertake a crusade against the Cliff Racers who plagued his homeland.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The eradicator</strong> - Atop a Silt Strider, Jiub traveled the Ashlands, hunting and killing many Cliff Racers. On one instance of hunting, Jiub followed a stray Cliff Racer, which led him to an entire nest of them. The battle lasted two full days, with Jiub the victor over seventy six Cliff Racers. Afterwards, he collapsed into a dark sleep.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sainthood</strong> - Jiub awoke in the Palace of Vivec in front of Vivec himself, who had admired his virtue and rescued him from death. Vivec canonized Jiub and he was known as a great hero throughout Morrowind and was earned many titles. A fair known as Saint Jiub's Fair began in honor of him and was celebrated in many places, including Cheydinhal.
